            <h2>"Why is Mental Health important?"</h2>
            <p>Despite what you may think, mental health is actually very important.
                Mental health can affect how we process reality and how we cope with things in our life.
                From emotional trauma to the smallest inconveniences, our mentality helps to keep us going in life.
                A poor mental health can result in a terrible lifestyle.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a terrible mental health can lead to a descent into suicide.<br><br>
                Sometimes repressing "<em>just a few bad moments</em>" can lead to a serious mental illness.</p>
            <p>The point is, everyone should take care of their mental health. As a human being and according to the constitutional rights, we all have the right to chase after the "pursuit of happiness" (Jefferson).</p>
