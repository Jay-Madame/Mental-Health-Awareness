        <p><div class = "subhead">Please note: this is NOT a tutorial on self-diagnosing. This is just a suggestion on what to ask yourself
            if you feel like you need mental help.</div>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Step One: Address your mental health</h2>
        <p> The first step to getting help is to look at yourself and evalutate your mental health. Is your thinking off?
            Have you behaving weirdly lately? Suicidal thoughts? Loss of sleep? Stressed out over the little things?
            Lack of interest in your favorite activities and hobbies? Dietary changes? Weight changes? All of these are
            just some of the examples you can evaluate yourself on to see if your mental health is declining.
        </p>
        <h2> Step Two: Health lines</h2>
        <p>
            Try contacting various hotlines and mental health lines. You can visit here at the website called <a href = https://www.nami.org/help>
            Nami</a> to find local mental health services and lines. This is mostly just contacting mental health 
            services for advice on your mental health and what to do.
        </p>
        <h2> Step Three: Local services </h2>
        <p>
            It seems to be the same as step two, but instead of contacting services over the phone anonomyously,
            you go out in person to set up long-term therapy with a mental health service offered locally.
        </p>
        <h2> Step Four: Talk with your relationships </h2>
        <p>
            Of course, that's easier said than done. It's probably easier to talk to a professional about your issues
            and random strangers rather than to talk to people who you have to see everyday. But in the end, it's worth it.
            So go out to your parents, siblings, friends, spouse, partner, etc. and talk to them. Tell them what's going on,
            how you feel, and what you're gonna do. It's gonna be really awkward, but your relationships will grow stronger as
            a result.
        </p>
        <h2> Step Five: Build a support system</h2>
        <p>
            No matter what's your mental disorder or issue, it's great to always have a support system. Even if it's a 
            disorder with no cure, it's still a good idea. Put people you can trust into your support system. Those 
            people should help you with your process in getting better. And even when that's said and done, your support
            system should remain afterwards. Your support system should stick with you throughout your entire life, and just
            be a source for support and comfort for whatever you do in life.
